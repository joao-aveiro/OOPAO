# OOPAO
Object Oriented Python Adaptive Optics (OOPAO) is a project under development to propose a python-based tool to perform end-to-end AO simulations. 
It is inspired from the OOMAO architecture: https://github.com/cmcorreia/LAM-Public
The project was initially intended for personal use, i tried to make it user-friendly so it can benefit to other users.
